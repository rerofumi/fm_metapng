[日本語](README.md) | English

fm_metapng is a tool that extracts and displays prompt information generated by AI embedded within PNG files. This repository parses the text data (specifically, the "parameters" keyword) from the PNG file at runtime to display the prompt content.

## Features

- Extracts prompt information embedded in PNG files.
- Reformats "Negative prompt:" for enhanced readability.
- Outputs a message when no prompt information is found.

## Usage

1. Run the tool by specifying the path to a PNG file as an argument:
    ```sh
    cargo run -- path/to/your_image.png
    ```
2. If a valid PNG file is provided, the prompt information will be printed to the console.
